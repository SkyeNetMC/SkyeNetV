# SkyeNetV
The Velocity Plugin for SkyeNet, the Minecraft Server network

## TODO List
- Make a `/sudo` command that executes a command as console on the current server (not on the velocity proxy console)
- Make a command to toggle whether the player receives the console log (for example, to see the output of `/sudo`
- Make `/sudo` not be able to be executed by the console
- Make `/start <server>` command
- Make `/stopserver <server>` command
