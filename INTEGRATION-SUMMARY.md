# Chat Filter Integration Summary

## What We've Accomplished

✅ **Successfully integrated the ChatFilterModule into the SkyeNetV Velocity plugin**

### Key Changes Made:

1. **Converted Bukkit ChatFilterModule to Velocity**
   - Replaced Bukkit events with Velocity events (`PlayerChatEvent`)
   - Updated imports and dependencies
   - Removed Bukkit-specific code
   - Added async event handling with `EventTask`

2. **Updated Project Dependencies**
   - Added SnakeYAML dependency for YAML configuration parsing
   - Maintained existing Adventure Text dependencies

3. **Integrated into Main Plugin**
   - Modified `SkyeNetV.java` to initialize and register the chat filter
   - Added command registration for `/chatfilter`
   - Updated chat event handler to work with filtered messages

4. **Created Command Interface**
   - `ChatFilterCommand.java` provides admin commands
   - Supports reload functionality
   - Permission-based access control

5. **Network-wide Filtering**
   - Now filters messages across ALL servers connected to the Velocity proxy
   - Works before messages reach individual servers
   - Integrates with existing Discord integration

### Features Implemented:

- **Word List Filtering**: Block specific words/phrases
- **Regex Pattern Filtering**:
  - IP address detection and blocking
  - Spam character detection (repeated characters)  
  - Excessive caps detection
  - Custom regex patterns
- **Bypass Permissions**: Different permission levels for different filter types
- **Configurable Messages**: Customizable notification messages
- **Real-time Configuration**: Reload without restart
- **Debug Mode**: Detailed logging for troubleshooting

### Configuration Files Created:

1. `chatfilter-config.yml` - Main configuration
2. `chatfilter/wordlist.yml` - Blocked words list
3. `chatfilter/regex.yml` - Regex patterns and rules

### Commands Added:

- `/chatfilter reload` - Reload configuration
- `/chatfilter help` - Show help

### Permissions Added:

- `skyenetv.chatfilter.admin` - Admin commands
- `skyenetv.chatfilter.bypass` - Bypass all filters  
- `skyenetv.wordlist.bypass` - Bypass wordlist only
- `skyenetv.regex.bypass` - Bypass regex only

## Testing Notes:

The plugin has been successfully compiled and packaged. The JAR file is ready for deployment:
- **Location**: `/mnt/sda4/SkyeNetwork/SkyeNetV/target/SkyeNetV-2.2.jar`
- **Size**: 40KB
- **Status**: ✅ Compiled successfully
- **Version**: Updated to 2.2 with chat filter integration

## Configuration Loading:

The chat filter will automatically:
1. Copy existing filter files from `filters/regex.yml` and `filters/wordlist.yml` to plugin data directory
2. Load comprehensive word list (785+ blocked terms) 
3. Load regex patterns for IP blocking, spam detection, caps filtering, and custom patterns
4. Enable network-wide filtering across all connected servers

## Deployment Instructions:

1. Stop your Velocity server
2. Replace the old plugin JAR with the new one
3. Start your Velocity server
4. The chat filter will automatically create default configuration files
5. Customize the configurations as needed
6. Use `/chatfilter reload` to apply changes without restart

## Network Impact:

This implementation now provides **network-wide chat filtering** for your entire Velocity proxy network. Messages are filtered at the proxy level before they reach individual backend servers, ensuring consistent filtering across all servers in your network.

The chat filter integrates seamlessly with your existing Discord integration - only messages that pass the filter will be forwarded to Discord.
