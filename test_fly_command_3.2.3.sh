echo "üöÄ COMMAND SYNTAX:"
echo "   /fly                    - Toggle your own flight"
echo "   /fly on                 - Enable your flight"
echo "   /fly off                - Disable your flight"
echo "   /fly <player>           - Toggle another player's flight"
echo "   /fly <player> on        - Enable another player's flight"
echo "   /fly <player> off       - Disable another player's flight"

echo "üîê PERMISSIONS:"
echo "   skyenetv.fly            - Use /fly command on yourself"
echo "   skyenetv.fly.others     - Use /fly command on other players"
echo ""

echo "üì° HOW IT WORKS:"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Commands executed on Velocity proxy"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Plugin messages sent to backend servers"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Works across all servers in the network"
echo "   ‚Ä¢ Real-time flight mode changes"
echo ""

echo "üìù EXAMPLE USAGE SCENARIOS:"
echo ""
echo "Player on 'survival' types: /fly"
echo "‚îú‚îÄ Flight toggled on survival server"
echo "‚îî‚îÄ Player receives: 'Toggling flight mode...'"
echo ""

echo "Admin on 'lobby' types: /fly PlayerName on"
echo "‚îú‚îÄ PlayerName's flight enabled on their current server"
echo "‚îî‚îÄ Admin receives: 'Enabled flight for PlayerName!'"
echo ""

echo "Player switches from 'creative' to 'survival' server:"
echo "‚îú‚îÄ Flight status preserved by backend server logic"
echo "‚îî‚îÄ /fly command works immediately on new server"
echo ""

echo "üéØ FEATURES:"
echo "‚Ä¢ Cross-server compatibility: Works on any server in network"
echo "‚Ä¢ Player targeting: Enable/disable flight for other players"
echo "‚Ä¢ Action specification: Force on/off or toggle current state"
echo "‚Ä¢ Permission-based: Different permissions for self vs others"
echo "‚Ä¢ Real-time feedback: Immediate confirmation messages"
echo "‚Ä¢ Console support: Console can toggle any player's flight"

echo "‚öôÔ∏è  BACKEND SERVER REQUIREMENTS:"
echo "This command sends plugin messages to backend servers. Your backend servers need:"

echo "2. Message format:"
echo "   - String: Command ('FlyCommand')"
echo "   - String: Player UUID"

echo "üöÄ TESTING INSTRUCTIONS:"
echo "========================="
echo ""
echo "1. Deploy SkyeNetV-3.2.1.jar to your Velocity proxy"
echo "2. Configure permissions:"
echo "   - Grant 'skyenetv.fly' to players"
echo "   - Grant 'skyenetv.fly.others' to admins"
echo "3. Implement backend server plugin message handlers"
echo "4. Restart the proxy"

echo "üìã Test Cases:"
echo ""
echo "Basic Functionality:"
echo "‚Ä¢ Player uses /fly to toggle their own flight"
echo "‚Ä¢ Player uses /fly on to enable flight"
echo "‚Ä¢ Player uses /fly off to disable flight"
echo ""
echo "Cross-Server Testing:"
echo "‚Ä¢ Player enables flight on server A"
echo "‚Ä¢ Player switches to server B"
echo "‚Ä¢ Verify flight commands work on server B"
echo ""
echo "Admin Testing:"
echo "‚Ä¢ Admin toggles another player's flight"
echo "‚Ä¢ Admin enables flight for offline/online players"
echo "‚Ä¢ Console executes fly commands"
echo ""
echo "Permission Testing:"
echo "‚Ä¢ Player without 'skyenetv.fly' permission"
echo "‚Ä¢ Player without 'skyenetv.fly.others' permission"
echo "‚Ä¢ Verify proper permission error messages"

echo "‚ú® TECHNICAL DETAILS:"
echo "====================="
echo "‚Ä¢ Added: FlyCommand.java - Complete fly command implementation"
echo "‚Ä¢ Modified: SkyeNetV.java - Command registration"
echo "‚Ä¢ Protocol: Plugin message system for cross-server communication"
echo "‚Ä¢ Compatible: Works with existing network infrastructure"
echo "‚Ä¢ Flexible: Supports both toggle and explicit on/off actions"
