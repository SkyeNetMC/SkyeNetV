# Discord Integration Fix Summary

## Issue
Discord link was working one-way (Minecraft → Discord) but not the reverse direction (Discord → Minecraft).

## Root Cause
The Discord listener (`DiscordListener`) was being registered before the JDA (Java Discord API) instance was fully initialized, causing the listener to never receive Discord message events.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Listener Registration Timing
**File**: `DiscordManager.java`
- Moved `jda.addEventListener(new DiscordListener(...))` from the main plugin class to inside `DiscordManager.initialize()`
- Ensures the listener is only registered after JDA is fully ready (`awaitReady()`)

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling and Logging
**File**: `DiscordListener.java`
- Added comprehensive debug logging for received Discord messages
- Added null checks and error handling
- Added detailed logging for message filtering and broadcasting

**File**: `DiscordManager.java`
- Enhanced initialization logging with detailed status information
- Added error handling for message broadcasting
- Added list of available channels when target channel is not found

### 3. Added Diagnostic Tools
**File**: `DiscordCommand.java`
- Added `/discord test` - sends test message to verify Discord connection
- Added `/discord status` - shows Discord connection status and channel info
- Added `/discord reload` - reloads Discord configuration

**File**: `SkyeNetV.java`
- Added `getDiscordManager()` getter method for command access

### 4. Added Connection Verification
**File**: `DiscordManager.java`
- Added `isConnected()` method to check JDA and channel status
- Added `sendTestMessage()` for connection testing
- Automatic test message sent on successful initialization

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Update Configuration
Edit `discord_config.yml` with valid bot token and channel ID:
```yaml
discord:
  token: "YOUR_ACTUAL_BOT_TOKEN"
  channel: "YOUR_ACTUAL_CHANNEL_ID"
```

### 2. Deploy and Test
1. Stop your Velocity server
2. Replace the old plugin JAR with `target/SkyeNetV-2.4.3.jar`
3. Start the server and check logs for successful Discord initialization
4. Test bidirectional messaging:
   - Send message from Minecraft → should appear in Discord
   - Send message from Discord → should appear in Minecraft as `[Discord] Username: message`

### 3. Use Diagnostic Commands
- `/discord status` - Check connection status
- `/discord test` - Send test message to Discord
- `/discord reload` - Reload configuration if needed

## Expected Log Output
On successful initialization, you should see:
```
[INFO] Initializing Discord bot with token: [REDACTED]...
[INFO] JDA initialized, looking for channel ID: [CHANNEL_ID]
[INFO] Found Discord channel: [CHANNEL_NAME] (ID: [CHANNEL_ID])
[INFO] Discord listener initialized successfully!
[INFO] Test message sent to Discord successfully
[INFO] Discord bot initialized successfully!
```

When Discord messages are received:
```
[INFO] Received Discord message from Username: Hello from Discord!
[INFO] Broadcasting Discord message to Minecraft players: [Username] Hello from Discord!
[INFO] Sent Discord message to X online players
```

## Required Discord Bot Permissions
- Read Messages
- Send Messages  
- Read Message History
- Use External Emojis (optional)

The fix ensures proper listener registration timing and provides comprehensive diagnostics for troubleshooting Discord integration issues.
