# SkyeNetV Version 3.1.2 Complete

## Chat Duplicate Message Fix

### Issue
After implementing the global chat system in version 3.1.1, some users reported that they were still seeing duplicate messages in chat. Specifically:
1. When a player sent a message, they would see their own message twice (once with global chat format, once with local format)
2. This happened regardless of their global chat toggle state

### Root Cause Analysis
1. The issue was caused by how we were handling the player's own messages
2. When canceling the PlayerChatEvent, we needed to properly show a formatted message to the sender
3. However, our code was both showing the sender a message AND the Minecraft client was displaying its own message
4. When we tried to let the event through (without canceling), additional complications arose with Velocity proxy

### Solution
1. **Explicit Sender Message Handling**: Added specific code to send properly formatted messages to the sender with the correct global/local format
2. **SingleSource of Truth**: Made sure the sender's message is sent only once, with the correct formatting
3. **Event Management**: Always canceling the original event to maintain control over message formatting
4. **Format Consistency**: Ensuring that the sender sees the same format for their message as other players do

### Implementation Details
1. In `GlobalChatManager.java`:
   - Added explicit handling for the sender's own message at the beginning of the message processing
   - Made message format consistent with what other players see (including global chat emoji if enabled)
   - Simplified recipient loop to only handle other players once the sender's message is properly handled

2. In `ChatListener.java`:
   - Maintained consistent event handling strategy - always canceling the backend event
   - Letting the GlobalChatManager handle sending the formatted message to all players including the sender

### Testing
This implementation has been extensively tested for:
- Messages with global chat ON
- Messages with global chat OFF
- Messages through the `/gc` command
- Self-message appearance with proper formatting
- Cross-server communication
- No duplicate messages appearing in any scenario

### Future Improvements
- Consider adding a configuration option for chat format per server
- Look into more performant message routing for very high player counts
- Investigate caching LuckPerms prefix/suffix data for performance

## Deployment
1. Replace the existing JAR with the new 3.1.2 version
2. No configuration changes needed
3. No need to restart linked Discord bots
