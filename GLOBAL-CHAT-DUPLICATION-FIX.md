# Global Chat Duplication Fix

## Problem Summary
When global chat was toggled OFF, players would receive duplicate messages. This was especially noticeable when:
1. A player toggled global chat OFF
2. Subsequent messages would appear twice on their screen

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by conflicting message routing logic in the `GlobalChatManager` class:

1. The previous implementation tried to handle both global and local messaging in a way that created multiple pathways for message delivery
2. Players on the same server who had global chat enabled would qualify for multiple message delivery rules
3. When global chat was toggled, the conditions would overlap, causing some players to receive both versions of the message

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Complete Message Processing Rewrite
We rewrote the message routing system with a clear separation of responsibilities:

```java
public void processPlayerMessage(Player player, String message, boolean forceGlobal) {
    boolean isGlobalChat = forceGlobal || isGlobalChatEnabled(player);
    
    // Create separate formatted messages for global and local routing
    Component globalComponent = miniMessage.deserialize(globalFormattedMessage);
    Component localComponent = miniMessage.deserialize(localFormattedMessage);
    
    // Loop through all players to determine who sees what
    for (Player recipient : server.getAllPlayers()) {
        // Skip sending to self (will send at end)
        if (recipient.equals(player)) {
            continue;
        }
        
        boolean recipientHasGlobalOn = isGlobalChatEnabled(recipient);
        boolean sameServer = isSameServer(player, recipient);
        
        if (isGlobalChat) {
            // CASE: Sender has global chat ON
            if (recipientHasGlobalOn) {
                // Send global format to players with global chat ON
                recipient.sendMessage(globalComponent);
            } else if (sameServer) {
                // Send local format to same-server players with global OFF
                recipient.sendMessage(localComponent);
            }
        } else {
            // CASE: Sender has global chat OFF
            if (sameServer) {
                // Only send local format to same-server players
                recipient.sendMessage(localComponent);
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Send to self as well with correct format (Minecraft doesn't echo sent messages)
    if (isGlobalChat) {
        player.sendMessage(globalComponent);
    } else {
        player.sendMessage(localComponent);
    }
}
```

### 2. Key Improvements

1. **Separate Message Formats**: Create distinct global and local message components
2. **Skip Self During Routing**: Prevents accidental duplicate self-messages
3. **Mutually Exclusive Conditions**: Each recipient can only qualify for one message delivery path
4. **Explicit Self-Message**: Add explicit message back to sender with correct format at the end

### 3. Globe Emoji Logic

- The globe emoji (üåê) now correctly appears only when the sender has global chat ON
- Players see a consistent format based on the sender's global chat status

## Message Routing Rules

The new system follows these clear rules:

### When Sender has Global Chat ON:
- Players with global chat ON: Receive message with globe emoji
- Players on same server with global chat OFF: Receive message without globe emoji
- Players on other servers with global chat OFF: Receive nothing

### When Sender has Global Chat OFF:
- Players on same server: Receive message without globe emoji
- Players on other servers: Receive nothing

## Testing Confirmation

This fix has been tested and confirmed to eliminate the duplicate message issue while maintaining all expected functionality:

1. Global chat messages are routed correctly
2. Local chat messages are routed correctly  
3. The `/gc` command works as expected for both toggling and forced global messages
4. Globe emoji appears only for appropriate messages
5. No more duplicate messages in any scenario
