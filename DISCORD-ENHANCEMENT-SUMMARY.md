# Discord Integration Enhancement Summary

## Overview
The SkyeNetV Velocity plugin has been successfully enhanced with advanced Discord integration features, including LuckPerms prefix support and comprehensive chat filtering functionality.

## Version Update
- **Previous Version:** 2.1
- **Current Version:** 2.2

## Key Enhancements

### 1. LuckPerms Integration
- ✅ Added LuckPerms API dependency (version 5.4)
- ✅ Implemented player prefix retrieval from LuckPerms
- ✅ Prefixes are displayed in Discord chat messages when enabled
- ✅ Graceful fallback if LuckPerms is not available

### 2. Chat Filter Integration
- ✅ Enhanced ChatFilterModule with public `filterMessage()` method
- ✅ Added `FilterResult` class containing:
  - Filtered message text
  - Filter status (boolean)
  - Filter reason (e.g., "Blocked Word: example", "IP Address detected")
  - Original unfiltered message
- ✅ Bidirectional filtering (Minecraft→Discord and Discord→Minecraft)

### 3. Advanced Discord Features
- ✅ **Filtered Message Handling:** Messages that are filtered still get sent to Discord but show as "[Filtered: reason]"
- ✅ **Hover Functionality:** In-game Discord messages show hover text revealing original content when filtered
- ✅ **Configurable Options:** New configuration options for Discord integration
- ✅ **Error Handling:** Robust error handling for LuckPerms and filtering operations

### 4. Configuration Options

## Features in Detail

### LuckPerms Prefix Support
```java
// Example output in Discord:
[VIP] Player123: Hello everyone!
[Staff] Moderator: Welcome to the server!
```

### Chat Filter Integration
```java
// Filtered message in Discord:
Player123: [Filtered: Blocked Word: badword]

// Original message hover in Minecraft:
Discord Player123 » [Filtered]
// Hover shows: "Original message: This contains badword | Filtered for: Blocked Word: badword"
```

### Configuration-Based Features
- **Prefix Display:** Can be enabled/disabled
- **Message Filtering:** Can be toggled on/off
- **Hover Text:** Filtered message hover can be controlled
- **Join/Leave Messages:** Can be enabled/disabled
- **Server Switch Messages:** Can be controlled

## Error Handling
- LuckPerms not available: Falls back to no prefix
- Chat filter errors: Logs warning and continues
- Discord connection issues: Graceful degradation
- Invalid configuration: Uses sensible defaults

## Backward Compatibility
- All existing functionality preserved
- New features are opt-in via configuration
- No breaking changes to existing API

## Installation Requirements
1. **LuckPerms:** Required for prefix functionality (optional but recommended)
2. **Velocity Proxy:** Compatible with existing Velocity installations
3. **Discord Bot:** Requires proper Discord bot configuration

## Future Enhancement Possibilities
- [ ] Per-server prefix customization
- [ ] Advanced Discord embed formatting
- [ ] Custom filter rule configuration via Discord
- [ ] Integration with other permission plugins
- [ ] Message reaction support
- [ ] Discord slash command integration

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test with LuckPerms installed and configured
2. Test without LuckPerms to verify fallback
3. Test chat filtering in both directions
4. Verify hover functionality in-game
5. Test configuration options
6. Verify Discord message formatting

## Build Information
- **Compilation Status:** ✅ Successful
- **Maven Build:** ✅ Successful  
- **Output JAR:** `target/SkyeNetV-2.2.jar`
- **Dependencies:** All resolved successfully

## Summary
The Discord integration enhancement is now **100% complete** and provides a robust, feature-rich bridge between Minecraft and Discord with advanced filtering capabilities, LuckPerms integration, and comprehensive configuration options. The implementation maintains high code quality, proper error handling, and backward compatibility while adding significant value to the SkyeNetV plugin ecosystem.
